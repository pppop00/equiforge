# Anamnesis Research — INCIDENTS

Institutional memory of failure. Each entry is a real incident + the load-bearing rule that prevents recurrence. Treat as hard constraint, not advice. If a new run smells like one of these, **stop and re-read the relevant entry before proceeding**.

**Format contract.** Append-only. Never delete — supersede with a new entry that links back. Monotonic ids (`I-001`, `I-002`, …). Load-bearing fields: *what / why / rule / detection*; the rest is optional context.

**Lifecycle (optional).** Entries are `active` by default. When superseded, mark the old one:

- `- **Status:** superseded`
- `- **Superseded by:** I-NNN`

…and the new entry reciprocates with `- **Supersedes:** I-NNN`. `P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK` skips superseded entries (status `skipped`, follows the supersedes link); their `Detection` clauses no longer fire. **Never delete a superseded entry** — the historical record is the audit trail. `tools/io/lint_incidents.py` verifies that cross-references resolve and `Detection` clauses point to files that exist on disk.

## I-001 — P0 interactive gate bypassed by inventing a default

- **Date observed:** multiple runs prior to 2026-05-02
- **Phase:** `P0_palette` (same failure mode at `P0_lang`, `P0_sec_email`)
- **What happened:** Orchestrator hit an interactive gate with no `USER.md` sticky and no user reply, picked `palette = "default"` (or `report_language = "en"`) instead of halting, and proceeded. All six cards rendered with the wrong colour scheme; full EP rerun.
- **Root cause:** Conflating "auto mode is active" with "I am authorized to invent values for interactive gates." Interactive gates exist precisely *because* the answer is not derivable from prompt/environment; auto mode does not waive that.
- **Rule (load-bearing):** For `P0_lang`, `P0_sec_email`, `P0_palette`, the only allowed `meta/gates.json -> source` values are `user_response`, `USER.md sticky`, plus the gate-specific whitelisted extras (`explicit_phrase` for language; `skipped` / `declined` for SEC email). Strings like `auto_mode_default`, `inferred_from_prompt`, `default`, `assumed`, or any free-form value not in the whitelist are P0 violations and the run is not deliverable. **Auto mode is not an override.** No real user reply and no sticky ⇒ halt and ask.
- **Detection:** `meta/gates.json` post-run review; whitelist in `references/p0_gates.md`; orchestrator's "halt and wait" wording in `agents/orchestrator.md`.
- **Related contract:** `MEMORY.md` §"P0 gates"; `SKILL.md` §"P0 gates"; `references/p0_gates.md`.

## I-002 — P5 locked HTML template skipped, simplified hand-written report emitted

- **Date observed:** `RA_Capital_2026-05-01_*` (private investment manager) + ≥1 prior run
- **Phase:** `P5_html` (also implicates `P5_html_gate`, `P5_5_data_val`, `P6_pkg`)
- **What happened:** Issuer-level financials unavailable (private fund / family office / non-public). Writer/orchestrator decided the locked template "did not apply," skipped `tools/research/extract_template.py`, hand-wrote a ~200-line summary HTML, fabricated profile `institution_compat_no_secapi_no_cards` (not whitelisted), wrote `pass_with_scope_limitations` into `report_validation.txt`. Every layer of that chain forbidden.
- **Root cause:** Misreading "data is thin" as "template doesn't apply." The locked template is **never** scope-conditional. Its job when data is thin is to *make the gaps legible*, not to disappear.
- **Rule (load-bearing):**
  - **Every** Anamnesis Research run — public, private, hedge fund, family office, government entity, anything — fills the same SHA256-pinned locked skeleton extracted via `tools/research/extract_template.py`. No institution-compatible / private-company / scope-limited / simplified bypass.
  - When issuer statements are unavailable, fill locked sections with best-available proxies (AUM, strategy, top holdings, manager-level filings, peer macro) and label residual gaps inline.
  - `tools/research/validate_report_html.py` exit code is non-negotiable. Non-zero ⇒ discard HTML, rerun P5 from the extracted skeleton.
  - `report_validation.txt` top-line status is one of `pass | warn | critical`. `pass_with_scope_limitations`, `not_applicable`, `partial_pass` are fabrications.
  - `structure_conformance.json -> profile` ∈ the four `strict_*` profiles in `workflow_meta.json -> packaging_profiles`. Invented profile names = P6 violation.
- **Detection:** `tools/research/validate_report_html.py` (exit code); `tools/research/packaging_check.py` (profile/status); `P5_html_gate` retry loop. Also `agents/attackers/red_team_numeric.md` + `red_team_narrative.md` post-P5.5.
- **Related contract:** `MEMORY.md` §"Hard rules"; `SKILL.md` §"Hard floor"; `agents/orchestrator.md` §14; `references/phase_contract.md`.

## I-003 — SEC EDGAR User-Agent leaked to third-party fetches

- **Date observed:** 2026-05-03 (run `Intuit_2026-05-03_85a939ee`; behaviour pre-dates this run)
- **Phase:** any non-SEC outbound HTTP — observed at `P7_logo` (logo-production-agent), `news_intel` fetches, P1/P2 public-page scrapes (e.g. `investors.intuit.com`).
- **What happened:** `meta/run.json` resolved `sec_user_agent = "EquityResearchSkill/1.0 (oliverun6@gmail.com)"` from `P0_sec_email`. Downstream fetchers reused it as the global outbound `User-Agent`, transmitting the user's personal email to third-party hosts (IR sites, logo CDNs, news) that have no SEC need or obligation. PII leak.
- **Root cause:** Only one UA string defined in run state (`sec_user_agent`). `agents/sec_email_gate.md` describes it as the SEC EDGAR header without a sibling rule for non-SEC traffic, so fetchers default to the only UA they find, which carries an email designed for SEC compliance.
- **Rule (load-bearing):**
  - `sec_user_agent` is for SEC EDGAR endpoints **only** (`https://*.sec.gov/`, `https://data.sec.gov/`, `https://efts.sec.gov/`).
  - All other outbound HTTP — logo fetches, IR pages, news, peer pages, image hosts — MUST use a generic `User-Agent` containing **no email and no other PII** (e.g. `EquityResearchSkill/1.0`; project URL OK; personal email never).
  - `meta/run.json` must carry both fields explicitly: `sec_user_agent` (with email) and `public_user_agent` (PII-free). Fetchers pick by host, not by whichever is set.
  - If `sec_email == "declined"`, `sec_user_agent` is `null` and SEC fetches are gated; `public_user_agent` is still set and used for everything else.
- **Detection:** `tools/audit/user_agent_pii.py` runs in P12, writes `validation/user_agent_pii.json`. Scans `meta/run.jsonl` and captured request/fetch logs for occurrences of `sec_email` outside `*.sec.gov` hosts; fails if the email substring appears alongside a non-SEC URL, or if `public_user_agent` is missing / contains an email. Also `P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK` + red-team narrative review of P7 logo fetch logs.
- **Related contract:** `agents/sec_email_gate.md`; `agents/orchestrator.md` §P0_sec_email + §P7 logo; `references/p0_gates.md` §P0_sec_email; `MEMORY.md` §"P0 gates".

## I-004 — Porter Five `porter-text` slots filled with free narrative, QC-deliberation 5-li format skipped

- **Date observed:** 2026-05-03 (run `Wingstop_2026-05-03_38b52bfa/research/Wingstop_Research_CN.html`, lines 726 / 745 / 764 — company / industry / forward tabs)
- **Phase:** `P5_html` (writer `skills_repo/er/agents/report_writer_cn.md`); also surfaces at `P5_html_gate` and `report_validator`.
- **What happened:** All three `<div class="porter-text">` slots filled with one short prose paragraph each (e.g. company tab: `品牌心智强、SKU聚焦降低门店复杂度；但对鸡翅大宗商品波动仍敏感，加盟商盈利能力与同店走弱会影响扩张节奏与特许收入韧性。`). No `<ul>`, no five `<li>`, no `"经QC合议，维持<力名>为N分。……"` prefix per force. The structured five-bullet QC-deliberation format mandated by `references/report_style_guide_cn.md` was skipped. `structure_conformance.json` still passed because `porter_panel: 3` counts only the three tab containers, not their contents.
- **Root cause:** Writer treated `porter-text` as a free-form summary slot complementing the radar/score list, instead of as the structural carrier of the five-force narrative. The style guide describes the `<ul>` + 5 `<li>` + QC-prefix shape, but no automated gate enforced it post-render.
- **Rule (load-bearing):**
  - Each of `{{PORTER_COMPANY_TEXT}}`, `{{PORTER_INDUSTRY_TEXT}}`, `{{PORTER_FORWARD_TEXT}}` MUST be `<ul style="margin:0;padding-left:1.25em;">` with **exactly five `<li>`**, fixed order: 供应商议价能力 → 买方议价能力 → 新进入者威胁 → 替代品威胁 → 行业竞争强度 (EN reports: same five forces in identical order).
  - Each `<li>` MUST open with the QC-deliberation sentence:
    - **Maintained:** `经QC合议，维持<力名>为N分。……` or `经QC合议，决定将<力名>评分维持N分不变。……`
    - **Adjusted:** `经QC合议，决定将<力名>评分从X分调整为Y分。……` — only when `qc_audit_trail.json` records that change.
  - Free-running summary paragraphs ("品牌心智强、SKU聚焦……") are a P5 violation regardless of how informative.
  - Wording per force MUST cite the force by name (no "本维度") and MUST agree with `qc_audit_trail.json` / `porter_analysis.qc_deliberation`.
- **Detection:** `tools/research/validate_report_html.py` fail-closed — parse each `porter-text` div, require exactly one `<ul>`, count direct `<li>` == 5, verify each `<li>` starts with a whitelisted QC/no-QC sentence for the correct dimension at the correct index. `P5_html_gate` rejects on failure; `skills_repo/er/agents/report_validator.md` and `agents/attackers/red_team_narrative.md` surface as critical.
- **Related contract:** `skills_repo/er/references/report_style_guide_cn.md` §波特五力; `skills_repo/er/references/report_style_guide_en.md` (mirror EN rule); `skills_repo/er/agents/report_writer_cn.md` table row for `{{PORTER_COMPANY_TEXT}}`; mirror EN; `skills_repo/er/agents/qc_resolution_merge.md`; `skills_repo/er/agents/report_validator.md` §"中文 Porter 句式".

## I-005 — Metrics table content and verdict cell not enforced by validator

- **Date observed:** 2026-05-05 (run `Li_Auto_2026-05-05_dd577c81/research/Li_Auto_Research_CN.html`, lines 610–617)
- **Phase:** `P5_html`; also implicates `P5_html_gate`.
- **What happened:** Section II metrics table rendered seven rows of absolute P&L amounts (`营业收入 / 毛利润 / 营业利润 / 净利润 / 稀释EPS / 经营现金流 / 自由现金流`) instead of the nine ratio rows mandated by `skills_repo/er/references/financial_metrics.md` §"Metrics table YoY movement verdict" (`毛利率 / 营业利润率 / 净利率 / ROE / ROA / 资产负债率 / 利息保障倍数 / 每股收益（EPS）/ 自由现金流利润率`). The 4th-column verdict cell was also unconstrained — emitter wrote `显著恶化` on every row without any check against the controlled vocabulary. `validate_report_html.py` exit 0; `report_validation.txt` `pass`.
- **Root cause:** `tools/research/validate_report_html.py` had zero assertions on the metrics table — no row-name whitelist, no `<td>` count, no 4th-cell vocab. Same family as I-004 (validator silent on a slot's content shape), different slot.
- **Rule (load-bearing):**
  - The metrics table MUST contain **exactly nine `<tr>`** whose first `<td>` plain text matches the controlled ratio names per `financial_metrics.md` (CN: `毛利率`, `营业利润率`, `净利率`, `ROE`, `ROA`, `资产负债率`, `利息保障倍数`, `每股收益（EPS）` (alias `稀释EPS` accepted), `自由现金流利润率`; EN equivalents in the same file).
  - Each row MUST have **exactly four `<td>`** (指标 / 当年值 / 上年值 / 同比变动).
  - The 4th `<td>` plain text MUST match the controlled vocabulary — CN: `显著改善 | 改善 | 基本持平 | 恶化 | 显著恶化 | 权益缺口收窄 | 权益缺口扩大 | 期末股东权益为负 | 不适用`; EN: `Significantly improved | Improved | Stable | Deteriorated | Significantly deteriorated | Equity deficit narrowed | Equity deficit widened | Ending equity negative | N/A`.
- **Detection:** `tools/research/validate_report_html.py` parses `<table class="metrics-table"> <tbody>` and fails-closed if row count ≠ 9, any first-`<td>` is not in the ratio whitelist, any row has ≠ 4 `<td>`, or the 4th-`<td>` plain text is not in the controlled vocab. `P5_html_gate` rejects on failure.
- **Related contract:** `skills_repo/er/references/financial_metrics.md` §"Metrics table YoY movement verdict"; `skills_repo/er/agents/report_writer_cn.md` §`{{METRICS_ROWS}}`; mirror EN; `tools/research/validate_report_html.py`.

## I-006 — Logo transparency contract misread as white-background requirement

- **Date observed:** 2026-05-07
- **Phase:** `P7_logo` / `P11_render`
- **What happened:** In run `Spirit_Aviation_Holdings_2026-05-07_9a1b9cdb`, `cards/logo/spirit_wordmark.png` was switched to an opaque white-background PNG after user feedback, and Card 1 / Card 5 re-rendered with the white-backed logo. Contradicts the EP logo-production contract: clean transparent asset, no white container.
- **Root cause:** Operator acted on ambiguous visual feedback without re-reading `skills_repo/ep/agents/logo-production-agent.md` and `skills_repo/ep/SKILL.md` logo rules. Conflated "logo visibility/contrast problem" with "add a white background," even though the renderer pastes transparent logo assets directly onto the card background.
- **Rule (load-bearing):** Before changing any logo background treatment, re-read the EP logo-production instructions. Final `logo_asset_path` must point to a clean transparent PNG/WEBP regenerated from an official logo reference unless the brand's mark intrinsically includes a filled shape. Do not add an opaque white canvas or white logo container to satisfy contrast concerns — solve contrast via the correct transparent logo variant or a clean regeneration.
- **Detection:** Logo audit that opens `card_slots.logo_asset_path`, verifies alpha transparency exists for non-filled canvas regions, and flags opaque white-canvas logo assets unless explicitly justified as part of the official mark. For rendered cards, sample the Card 1 logo box (Card 1 is the only card that paints the logo in the current 4-card layout) to confirm the card background remains visible around the logo rather than a pasted white rectangle.
- **Related contract:** `skills_repo/ep/SKILL.md` §Logo convention / §2.5 Logo Production; `skills_repo/ep/agents/logo-production-agent.md` §Rules + §Quality Check; `skills_repo/ep/references/design-spec.md` §Logo Rules; `skills_repo/ep/scripts/generate_social_cards.py` `paste_logo()`, `card_1()`, `card_5()`.

## I-007 — Sector/theme research bypassed locked report and EP card format

- **Date observed:** 2026-05-09
- **Phase:** `P0_intent` / `P5_html` / `P6_pkg` / `P11_render`
- **What happened:** In run `Stablecoin_Cross_Border_Payments_2026-05-09_78540d26`, the user asked for an industry analysis. The run invented a custom `sector_pack` path, emitted a short non-locked HTML report, and generated custom cards outside the EP renderer. The initial report failed `validate_report_html.py` (missing locked-template markers, missing required sections, missing metrics table, line count < 500). The initial cards had visible large blank regions.
- **Root cause:** Orchestrator treated a sector/theme prompt as permission to bypass the formal Anamnesis report/card format instead of representing the industry as the analysis object inside the locked template. Confused "sector topic" with "template not applicable."
- **Rule (load-bearing):** Sector/industry research must still use the locked report skeleton and official EP card renderer unless the user explicitly requests a non-Anamnesis custom artifact. If issuer-level financials do not exist, fill the required financial, prediction, Sankey, and card fields with clearly labelled industry proxy metrics. Do not invent packaging profiles such as `sector_pack`. Do not claim analogous incident checks as pass.
- **Detection:** `tools/research/validate_report_html.py` and `tools/research/packaging_check.py` must pass before card work. `tools/photo/validate_cards.py` must pass before render. Reject `structure_conformance.json -> profile` values outside the whitelisted strict profiles.
- **Related contract:** `SKILL.md` Hard floor; `agents/orchestrator.md` P5/P6/P11; `tools/research/validate_report_html.py`; `tools/research/packaging_check.py`; `tools/photo/validate_cards.py`; `INCIDENTS.md` I-002 and I-005.

## I-008 — Waterfall / Sankey schema and Porter QC-prefix mode not enforced by validator

- **Date observed:** 2026-05-15 (regressions on `China_General_Nuclear_Power_2026-05-13_3fc946f7` and `NextEra_Energy_2026-05-13_2f081932`; minor latent flaws on `Waste_Management_2026-05-14_e20146cf` and `ADM_2026-05-13_7e0175b5`)
- **Phase:** `P5_html` (writer `skills_repo/er/agents/report_writer_cn.md`, mirror EN); detection sites `P5_html_gate`, `report_validator`.
- **What happened:** Three independent flaws, all undetected by the post-render validator:
    1. **Porter prefix mode-mismatch.** Both runs produced `qc_audit_trail.json` (full QC ran). Contract (`skills_repo/er/agents/qc_resolution_merge.md` §134 + `skills_repo/er/agents/report_writer_cn.md` row for `{{PORTER_COMPANY_TEXT}}`): when QC ran, every `<li>` opens with `"经QC合议，..."` (zh) / `"Dual-QC deliberation..."` (en); `"基于初稿评分，..."` / `"Per draft scoring..."` is reserved for fast-runs with no `qc_audit_trail.json`. Both reports used the no-QC prefix for all 15 `<li>`s (5 forces × 3 perspectives). User-visible: every bullet read "基于初稿评分，X 议价能力为 N 分。" — readers perceived this as draft/template residue.
    2. **`waterfallData` schema mismatch.** `drawWaterfall()` in the locked template expects `[{label, type, value, start, end}, …]` with `type ∈ {baseline, positive, negative, result}`. Both runs emitted `{label, type, value}` only (no `start`, no `end`) and a fabricated `type` vocab `{start, delta, end}`. `Math.max(...waterfallData.flatMap(d => [d.start, d.end]))` → `NaN`; y-scale collapses; **no bars render**. The -4.1% / -1.3% / +4.0% / -1.4% labels still appear via separate `<text>` elements, so the chart looks "halfway there" rather than blank.
    3. **Sankey conservation violation.** Both runs declared nodes never wired into any link (`费用`, `税前利润`, `税费` on CGN). For interior nodes that did receive flow, inflow ≠ outflow by > 1% (CGN: `毛利润` in 242 vs out 155 — 87 RMB-B silently dropped; NextEra: `毛利润` outflow > inflow by 2.7 USD-B — phantom money). `d3-sankey` drops orphans silently or renders disproportionate ribbons; readers cannot reconcile the income statement.
- **Root cause:** `tools/research/validate_report_html.py` verified only the *presence* of the JS data variables (`waterfallData`, `sankeyActualData`, `sankeyForecastData`) and that Porter `<li>` count was 5 — not their *schema*. The Porter prefix whitelist accepted **both** `"经QC合议..."` and `"基于初稿评分..."` openings unconditionally, regardless of whether `qc_audit_trail.json` existed on disk. Writer prompt was correct (it pairs each opening with the mode that justifies it); the safety net let either through. Same family as I-004 / I-005: writer contract correct, validator silent on slot content shape.
- **Rule (load-bearing):**
    - **Porter prefix is mode-gated.** Validator MUST inspect for a sibling `qc_audit_trail.json` next to the HTML. Present (QC ran) ⇒ every Porter `<li>` MUST open with `"经QC合议，..."` (zh) / `"Dual-QC deliberation..."` (en); no-QC openings forbidden. Absent (fast-run) ⇒ every `<li>` MUST open with `"基于初稿评分，..."` / `"Per draft scoring..."`; inventing `"经QC合议..."` wording without a real trail forbidden.
    - **`waterfallData` schema.** Each bar MUST be `{label: str, type: "baseline"|"positive"|"negative"|"result", value: number, start: number, end: number}`. Missing `start`/`end` or any unknown `type` is fail-closed.
    - **Sankey conservation.** Every declared node MUST appear in ≥ 1 link (orphans demoted to warning — render blank but don't break the chart). For nodes with both inflow and outflow, `|in − out| / max(in, out)` MUST be ≤ 1%. Larger imbalances indicate phantom or dropped flow and are fail-closed.
    - Not bypassable for "fast-run": schema + conservation are independent of QC presence.
- **Detection:** `tools/research/validate_report_html.py`:
    - `_validate_porter_texts(soup, *, qc_ran)` (new signature) — mode-gated via `validate_html_report(..., qc_audit_trail_path=None)`, which auto-detects `html_path.parent / "qc_audit_trail.json"` when not passed.
    - `_validate_waterfall_data(script_text)` — parses the `const waterfallData = [...]` literal via `_extract_js_literal` and enforces per-bar required fields + canonical `type` vocab.
    - `_validate_sankey_conservation(script_text, var_name)` — parses both `sankeyActualData` and `sankeyForecastData`; orphans warn; > 1% imbalance fails.
    - Tests: `tests/test_validate_report_html.py::test_i007_porter_no_qc_prefix_when_qc_ran_fails`, `…_porter_qc_prefix_when_no_qc_trail_fails`, `…_waterfall_missing_start_end_fails`, `…_waterfall_good_passes`, `…_sankey_orphan_warns`, `…_sankey_conservation_violation_fails`.
- **Related contract:** `skills_repo/er/agents/report_writer_cn.md` §`{{PORTER_COMPANY_TEXT}}` / `{{WATERFALL_JS_DATA}}` / `{{SANKEY_ACTUAL_JS_DATA}}`; `skills_repo/er/agents/qc_resolution_merge.md` §134; `skills_repo/er/references/porter_framework.md` §QC vs no-QC openings; `skills_repo/er/references/report_style_guide_cn.md` §波特五力; `INCIDENTS.md` I-004 (this entry tightens I-004's detection from "must start with whitelisted sentence" to "must start with the *correct-mode* sentence").

## I-009 — Card 1 renderer-generated metrics drifted from report KPI intent

- **Date observed:** 2026-05-16
- **Phase:** `P11_render` / `P10_validator1`
- **What happened:** In `output/Yangtze_Memory_Technologies_2026-05-16_7f447232/cards/01_cover.png`, Card 1 rendered net income as `-11200 万元` while the report KPI in `research/Yangtze_Memory_Technologies_Research_CN.html` used `归母净利润 -1.12亿元`. The same card also rendered `经营现金流 25.0 亿元` even though the report and Card 3 narrative emphasized `自由现金流 -75亿元`.
- **Root cause:** Card 1 metrics are renderer-generated from `financial_data.json`, not authored in `card_slots.json`. `money_text()` chose units using signed value thresholds, so negative 亿 amounts could fall into 万元 formatting. `operational_metric()` also prioritized operating cash flow whenever present, even when negative free cash flow was the report's core cash-flow KPI.
- **Rule (load-bearing):** Card 1 renderer-generated metrics must match the report's KPI intent and unit scale. Money formatting must choose units using absolute magnitude. If `free_cash_flow < 0`, Card 1 must prefer `自由现金流` over positive operating cash flow unless explicitly overridden.
- **Detection:** Add Validator 1 coverage for Card 1 generated metrics: compare rendered metric labels/values implied by `generate_social_cards.py` against `financial_data.json`, `financial_analysis.json`, and HTML KPI labels; fail if net income unit scale drifts or FCF-negative runs render OCF as the primary cash-flow metric. Manual visual review caught this run.
- **Related contract:** `skills_repo/ep/scripts/generate_social_cards.py` `money_text()` / `operational_metric()` / `cover_metrics()`; `tools/photo/validate_cards.py`; `skills_repo/ep/agents/validation-agent.md`; `INCIDENTS.md` I-005 and I-008.

## I-010 — Card renderer mixed quarterly prose with annual financial pool

- **Date observed:** 2026-05-19
- **Phase:** `P8_content` / `P11_render` / `P12_final_audit`
- **What happened:** In run `output/Datadog_2026-05-19_ddog20260519`, the card prose described 2026Q1 metrics — e.g. `cards/Datadog_Research_CN.card_slots.json` used `Q1收入10.06亿美元`, `经营现金流3.35亿美元`, and `FCF 2.89亿美元` — while renderer-generated Card 1 / Card 3 headline metrics initially displayed FY2025 annual values as Q1 values. The user caught that `cards/01_cover.png` and `cards/03_revenue.png` showed `Q1总收入 34.3亿美元`, `经营现金流 10.5亿美元`, and `净利润 1.1亿美元`, which belong to the FY2025 annual pool rather than the Q1 2026 pool. After correction, `validation/ocr_dump/card_1.txt` and `validation/ocr_dump/card_3.txt` showed Q1-aligned values (`10.1`, `3.3`, `0.5` rounded by OCR/rendering), and `validation/post_card_audit.json -> status` became `pass`.
- **Root cause:** EP cards generate several visible numerics directly from `research/financial_data.json -> income_statement.current_year` and `cash_flow`, not from the authored `card_slots.json` prose. The run mixed periods inside `financial_data.json`: `latest_quarter` carried Q1 2026 values, but the renderer-facing `income_statement.current_year` and `cash_flow` initially carried FY2025 annual values. Validator 1 accepted the card prose and P12 reconciliation compared slot prose numerics against research JSON, but neither gate checked that renderer-generated OCR numerics and period labels matched the prose period (`Q1`) and the intended data pool.
- **Rule (load-bearing):** When card prose uses a quarter or interim period (`Q1`, `Q2`, `quarterly`, `interim`), every renderer-generated headline metric on Card 1 and Card 3 must use the same period's financial pool. `financial_data.json -> income_statement.current_year.period` must explicitly name the renderer period, and the values under `income_statement.current_year` / `cash_flow` must correspond to that period. Annual facts may be retained only under explicit annual keys such as `annual_fy2025`; they must not sit in renderer-facing `current_year` when the card copy says Q1. Mixed-period cards are release-blocking even when all numbers are individually present somewhere in research JSON.
- **Detection:** Add a deterministic card period-consistency gate in Validator 1 or P12: infer the card period from `card_slots` text and `financial_data.income_statement.current_year.period`, recompute the renderer-generated Card 1 / Card 3 values from `financial_data`, OCR the rendered PNGs, and fail if visible headline values match a different period pool than the prose period. The check should specifically compare Card 1 cover metrics and Card 3 revenue-flow bars against `latest_quarter` when the copy says Q1, and against annual data only when the copy and `current_year.period` are annual. Existing `tools/audit/reconcile_numbers.py` is insufficient because it only reconciles authored slot numerics, not renderer-generated numerics.
- **Related contract:** `skills_repo/ep/scripts/generate_social_cards.py` `statement_period_label()` / `income_current()` / `finance()` / `cover_metrics()` / `card_3()`; `tools/photo/validate_cards.py`; `tools/audit/reconcile_numbers.py`; `tools/audit/ocr_cards.py`; `INCIDENTS.md` I-009.

For each incident it confirms the rule is wired into the current plan and logs `incident_precheck.acknowledged` to `meta/run.jsonl`. Novel-looking matches against the current target raise the bar in downstream phases.
2. **Post-run** (`P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK`, after `P12_final_audit`, before `P_DB_INDEX`): orchestrator re-reads and confirms each detection signal is green. Output: `validation/incident_postcheck.json` with `status: pass | flagged` + evidence path per incident. A flagged entry blocks `P_DB_INDEX`.
3. **On new failure**: user runs `/log-incident <one-line description>`. Claude pulls the latest `meta/run.jsonl`, the user's description, and phase outputs; drafts a candidate entry; user confirms; entry appended here as `I-NNN`.
