# Anamnesis Research — Project Memory

These rules are **load-bearing** and apply to every run. They are read once at session start and frozen into `meta/system_prompt.frozen.txt`. `INCIDENTS.md` is loaded alongside this file at the same moment and into the same frozen prompt — it carries the project's institutional memory of past failure modes (one entry per incident, with the load-bearing rule that prevents recurrence). Read both. The contracts compose: anything in `INCIDENTS.md` overrides nothing here, and nothing here waives anything in `INCIDENTS.md`.

## Orchestrator model gate

`anamnesis.py bootstrap` requires `--orchestrator-model <your-model-id>` and refuses Haiku/Instant families. Reason: the harness has 35+ phases, four P0 interactive gates, and an incident pre/post-check loop. Fast/cheap models historically compressed this contract aggressively and skipped interactive gates (`INCIDENTS.md` I-001) and the locked template (`I-002`). The gate is enforced by `tools/io/model_gate.py`; gate logic is substring-based on the declared id so future Opus/Sonnet suffixes pass without code change. Subagents (logo, card-content, scrape workers) may still use Haiku — only the orchestrator declared at bootstrap is gated.

## P0 gates — ordered, blocking, not skippable

1. **`P0_intent`** — resolve the user's prompt to a concrete `{ticker, company, listing}` triple. If ambiguous, ask **once**.
2. **`P0_lang`** — `report_language ∈ {en, zh}`. If not derivable from explicit phrases per `skills_repo/er/SKILL.md` §0A.1, ask the bilingual gate question and **stop until answered**. Do not infer from chat language alone.
3. **`P0_sec_email`** — only when `listing == US` AND `Mode A` (no PDFs uploaded) AND `USER.md` has no sticky decision. Ask for a real email or accept explicit decline. Reject obvious placeholders (`example.com`, `test@test`, `user@localhost`) with one re-ask. Persist `sec_user_agent` for SEC hosts and `public_user_agent` for all non-SEC HTTP; the latter must contain no email.
4. **`P0_palette`** — `palette ∈ {macaron, default, b, c}`. Ask before any EP work.

`USER.md` may pre-fill any of P0_lang / P0_sec_email / P0_palette as sticky preferences.

## Never-skip phases

These five phases are non-skippable in any run, fast or slow. They exist because real prior failures showed up when each one was bypassed — the rule and the incident travel together.

- **`P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK`** — read `INCIDENTS.md` end-to-end and write `incident_precheck.acknowledged` events before `P0_intent`. A run that did not pre-check is not deliverable.
- **`P5_7_RED_TEAM` and `P10_7_RED_TEAM`** — the red-team attackers (`agents/attackers/red_team_numeric.md`, `red_team_narrative.md`) are **not** QC peers. QC peers vote and average; attackers try to falsify. Critical findings loop the writer once (cap = 1 per phase); a second critical halts the run.
- **`P12_final_audit`** — the four-layer audit (reconcile / OCR / web third-check / DB cross-validate). The paying-customer gate. Skip only on an explicit user instruction in the same turn, and log a `phase_skipped` event when you do.
- **`P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK`** before `P_DB_INDEX` — a flagged post-check on a known incident means the harness relapsed. **`P_DB_INDEX` does not run** if P12 failed or post-check is flagged.
- **The four P0 gates** — `P0_intent` (resolution), `P0_lang` / `P0_sec_email` / `P0_palette` (interactive). Auto-mode does not waive interactive gates; inventing a default is a P0 violation (`INCIDENTS.md` I-001). The gate-source whitelist is in `references/p0_gates.md` and enforced at `python anamnesis.py advance` time.

## Locked template invariants

These four rules all stem from the same failure family (`INCIDENTS.md` I-002): the locked HTML report skeleton is universal — public, private fund, hedge fund, family office, government entity, anything — and there is no scope-limited bypass.

- **Locked HTML skeleton.** `skills_repo/er/agents/report_writer_{cn,en}.md` is SHA256-pinned. P5 must extract via `tools/research/extract_template.py` and substitute `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers only; do not edit structure. When issuer-level financials are unavailable, fill the locked sections with proxies (AUM / strategy / holdings / manager filings) and label gaps inline. Never drop sections, shorten the template, or emit a hand-written page.
- **No simplified HTML accepted.** After P5, `tools/research/validate_report_html.py` is fail-closed. Line-count / section / JS / template-marker failure means P5 did not use the locked skeleton — rerun P5 before P6/P7. There is no "institution-compatible" / "private-company" / "scope-limited" / "simplified" bypass.
- **Packaging profile whitelist.** `structure_conformance.json -> profile` must be one of the four `strict_*` profiles in `workflow_meta.json -> packaging_profiles`. Strings like `institution_compat_*`, `private_company_*`, `scope_limited_*`, `sector_pack` are fabrications and will be rejected.
- **Status string whitelist.** `report_validation.txt`'s top-line status and `structure_conformance.json -> html_template_gate.status` are exactly `pass | warn | critical`. Hand-written verdicts (`pass_with_scope_limitations`, `not_applicable`, `partial_pass`) are fabrications and not deliverable.

## Hard rules

- **Logo save order.** P7 must (a) create the per-run output folder first, (b) save `logo_official.png` directly into it, (c) set `logo_asset_path` to the absolute path inside that folder, (d) only then proceed. Final asset must be a transparent PNG/WEBP — no opaque white canvas (`INCIDENTS.md` I-006).
- **Palette consistency.** All four cards in one run must use the same `--palette`. The palette is **not** stored in `card_slots.json`; mismatched single-card re-renders cause silent header colour drift.
- **No fallback copy generation in EP.** `card_slots.json` must be complete before render; missing keys abort at load time.
- **No user emails persisted to the DB.** SEC EDGAR email is a runtime arg only. Live in `meta/run.json` as `sec_email` / `sec_user_agent`; never in any DB TEXT column. `public_user_agent` (PII-free) is the only User-Agent for non-SEC fetches (`INCIDENTS.md` I-003). Regression: `tests/test_db_pii.py`.
- **Submodules are SHA-pinned, not editable in-place.** `skills_repo/er/` and `skills_repo/ep/` are pinned via `.gitmodules`. Runtime wrappers must resolve only those submodule paths, never sibling working-copy fallbacks. Behaviour changes to standalone ER/EP happen in their own repos; Anamnesis picks them up only through a deliberate submodule SHA bump.
- **Numerical reconciliation tolerance** (P12 layer 1):
  - margins / ratios / percentage points: ±0.5pp
  - currency amounts: ±0.5% relative
  - growth rates: ±0.5pp
  - prices, share counts, or any value tagged `"exact": true`: 0 tolerance

## QC scoring math (P3.6) — plan v3 single perspective

Porter is **one perspective × 5 forces × 6 mandatory segments per force** (schema v2). The 3-perspective layout (`company` / `industry` / `forward`) was removed by plan v3. Anything still emitting v1-shape `porter_analysis.json` is a defect — `tools/research/validate_porter_analysis.py` rejects v1 with a migration hint.

For each of the 5 forces: `weighted = 0.34·draft + 0.33·peer_a + 0.33·peer_b`.
- `delta = |weighted − draft|`
- If `delta > 1.00` → change score to `round(weighted)`, clamped to 1–5.
- If `delta ≤ 1.00` → keep draft, mark as "maintain X" (never fabricate "from X to Y").

Reasoning-only QC items must say "maintain X". Only QC items with an actual score change in the audit trail may say "from X to Y".

Per force, the QC peers and merge agent additionally audit all 6 segments:
`qc_statement` / `data_anchor` / `mechanism` / `falsifier` / `primary_signal` / `look_ahead`.
Missing or under-length segments block resolution; `P5_6_porter_depth_gate` then blocks `P5_7_RED_TEAM`.

## Porter score orientation

Threat / pressure scale (not attractiveness):
- 1–2 = low threat / green
- 3 = mixed / amber
- 4–5 = high threat / red

Intense rivalry → high red; minimal competition → low green. Reverse this and Validator and reviewers will catch it.

## Cards 1–4 voice governed by analyst-content gate (plan v3)

The card pack is **4 cards** (cover / Porter / 5-year + recent financials / CFA lens). Card 1–4 prose is governed by `validate_card1_4_analytical_content()` in `skills_repo/ep/scripts/generate_social_cards.py`, called at `P10_6_voice_gate`. The writer must emit two parallel JSONs:

- `<Company>_Research_<lang>.card_slots.json` (rendered prose, schema v2: `logo_asset_path`, `cover_company_name_cn`, `intro_sentence`, `company_focus_paragraph`, `metrics_row`, `industry_paragraph`, `background_bullets`, `porter_scores`, `porter_evidence`, `five_year_arc` (nested with `narrative` + `inflection_points`), `recent_financial_highlights`, `revenue_explainer_points`, `cfa_lens` (nested with `concept_key`, `concept_name_cn`, `concept_intro`, `company_application`, `different_angle_insight`, `takeaway`, `cfa_progress_source`))
- `<Company>_Research_<lang>.card_slots_worker_notes.json` (hidden analyst fields per Card 1-4 slot: `data_anchor` with number + comp, `variant_view` ≥15 chars, plus ≥1 of `falsifier` / `primary_quote` / `catalyst_with_date`; Card 4's authority slot `cfa_lens.company_application` requires `primary_quote`)

Backstop banned phrases on Cards 1-4: `说白了`, `X 不是 Y 而是 Z` template, `已不是核心叙事 / 已不重要 / 体现了 / 总而言之 / 综上 / 简单来说`, "关注 X 每天学一个公司" subscription-bait CTA.

`cfa_lens.concept_key` is selected by EP's CFA-concept selector from the `cfa_progress` string passed by Anamnesis (read from `USER.md:cfa_progress` and propagated to EP via `--cfa-progress` on `validate_cards.py` and `generate_social_cards.py`). When `USER.md:cfa_progress` is unset, EP falls back to its own default.

`P10_6_voice_gate` blocks `P10_7_RED_TEAM`, `P11_render`, and `P_DB_INDEX` on failure. Red-team narrative §6.a attacks the substance of what passes the deterministic gate.

## Database write rules

- `P_DB_INDEX` runs only after `P12_final_audit` passes and `P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK` reports `flagged: []`. Failed audits or flagged incident post-checks do not write to DB.
- All writes for one run are inside a single transaction; failure → rollback + `runs.run_status='failed'` + `db_export/index_error.json`.
- Append-only tables (`intelligence_signals`, `disclosure_quirks`) survive partial-run admission with an analyst note.
- Cross-validation queries (`db/queries.py`) filter on `runs.run_status='complete'` by default; partial rows exist for audit only.

## Privacy invariants

- SEC EDGAR email is **never** persisted. It lives only as a runtime arg to `tools/research/sec_edgar_fetch.py`.
- Before inserting any TEXT column, run `re.sub(r'\([^)]*@[^)]*\)', '()', value)` on `data_source` strings to strip embedded emails (User-Agent leak guard).
- `tests/test_db_pii.py` is a regression: any TEXT column matching `[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}` after a fixture run = test fails = release blocked.

## Failure caps

- Single ER subagent failure → 2 retries with same prompt, then halt.
- `P10.5_validator2` ↔ `P10_validator1` loop cap = 3.
- `P5.5` → `P5` (data validation fail → rewrite) cap = 2.
- Subagent timeouts: research 600s / photo 300s / QC 180s; first timeout retries at ×1.5; second timeout = phase failure.
- `P12` has no auto-retry — failures surface to the user with paths and a "which upstream phase to re-run" question.

## Incident loop (load-bearing)

- `P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK` runs **before** `P0_intent`. The orchestrator reads `INCIDENTS.md` end-to-end and writes one `incident_precheck.acknowledged` event to `meta/run.jsonl` per entry.
- `P5_7_RED_TEAM` and `P10_7_RED_TEAM` run two adversarial agents in parallel (`agents/attackers/red_team_numeric.md`, `red_team_narrative.md`). They are **not** QC peers — QC peers vote, attackers try to falsify. Critical findings loop the writer once (cap = 1 per phase); a second critical halts the run.
- `P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK` runs **after** `P12_final_audit` and **before** `P_DB_INDEX`. The orchestrator re-reads `INCIDENTS.md` and confirms each entry's detection signal is green for this run. A flagged post-check blocks DB write — a relapse on a known incident is a release-blocking event.
- New failure modes are captured by the user via the `/log-incident` slash command (spec at `.claude/commands/log-incident.md`, backend at `tools/io/log_incident.py`). The model drafts an `INCIDENTS.md` entry; the user confirms; only then is it appended. Append-only — never delete or rewrite past entries; supersede with a new entry if needed.

## What this project does NOT do

- No skill self-improvement / DSPy / GEPA optimizer. Auditability beats agility.
- No code-execution sandbox. Everything is a registered tool; LLM cannot exec arbitrary Python.
- No multi-tenant routing. Single-user, local SQLite, single process.
- No streaming UI. CLI in, files out.
