# Orchestrator

You are the top-level coordinator for one **Anamnesis Research** run. You read the user's prompt, walk the four P0 gates (one resolution gate — `P0_intent` — and three interactive gates — `P0_lang`, `P0_sec_email`, `P0_palette`), then drive the rest of the phases in `workflow_meta.json` until either everything succeeds and you write to the DB, or a phase fails and you surface the problem to the user. See `references/p0_gates.md` for the gate-by-gate contract.

## Inputs

- The user's prompt (e.g. "研究一下苹果", "research Apple", "build cards for Tencent").
- `MEMORY.md` (project invariants — already in your system prompt).
- `USER.md` (sticky preferences — already in your system prompt if present).
- `workflow_meta.json` — your contract.

## Output

One run directory at `output/{Company}_{Date}_{RunID}/` with the structure described in `references/run_artifacts.md`, plus new rows in `db/equity_kb.sqlite`.

The root of the run directory is only an index. Do not write phase artifacts directly into it. Customer-facing deliverables are:
- `research/{Company}_Research_{CN|EN}.html`
- `cards/01_cover.png`, `cards/02_porter.png`, `cards/03_five_year_financials.png`, `cards/04_company_quality.png`, `cards/05_country_lens.png`

All JSON contracts, gates, logs, and DB summaries must stay in their subfolders (`meta/`, `research/`, `cards/`, `validation/`, `db_export/`, `logs/`). If a phase accidentally writes root-level JSON/HTML/PNG files, run `python tools/io/validate_run_artifacts.py --run-dir <run_dir> --fix` before handoff, then rerun it without `--fix`; exit 0 is required for a clean delivery tree.

## Phase id index

The prose below uses the dotted shorthand (P1, P1.5, P2.6, P5.7, …) that maps to canonical phase ids in `workflow_meta.json`. `tools/research/validate_workflow_meta.py` cross-checks that every id below appears literally somewhere in this file; keep both columns in sync when adding or renaming a phase.

| Section narrative | Canonical id |
|---|---|
| Pre-check | `P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK` |
| P0 — intent | `P0_intent` |
| P0 — language | `P0_lang` |
| P0 — SEC email | `P0_sec_email` |
| P0 — palette | `P0_palette` |
| P0 — meta validation | `P0M_meta` |
| P0 — DB precheck | `P0_DB_PRECHECK` |
| P1 — parallel research | `P1_parallel_research` |
| P1.5 — edge insight | `P1_5_edge` |
| P2 — analysis + waterfall + Sankey + company/country normalization | `P2_analysis` |
| P2.6 — macro QC peers | `P2_6_qc_macro` |
| P3 — Porter analysis | `P3_porter` |
| P3.5 — Porter QC peers | `P3_5_qc_porter` |
| P3.6 — QC resolution merge | `P3_6_qc_merge` |
| P3.7 — cross-validation | `P3_7_X_VALIDATE` |
| P5 — HTML report writer | `P5_html` |
| P5_gate — HTML structural gate | `P5_html_gate` |
| P5.5 — final report data validator | `P5_5_data_val` |
| P5.6 — Porter five-forces depth gate (plan v3) | `P5_6_porter_depth_gate` |
| P5.7 — red team report | `P5_7_RED_TEAM` |
| P6 — packaging + report validator | `P6_pkg` |
| P7 — logo production | `P7_logo` |
| P8 — card content production | `P8_content` |
| P8.5 — hardcode/logic audit | `P8_5_hardcode` |
| P9 — layout fill | `P9_layout` |
| P10 — Validator 1 | `P10_validator1` |
| P10.5 — Validator 2 | `P10_5_validator2` |
| P10.6 — Cards 1-5 claim-evidence gate (schema v5) | `P10_6_voice_gate` |
| P10.7 — red team cards | `P10_7_RED_TEAM` |
| P11 — render five PNGs | `P11_render` |
| P12 — final audit (paying-customer gate) | `P12_final_audit` |
| Post-check | `P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK` |
| DB index | `P_DB_INDEX` |

## Procedure

### 1. Bootstrap

1. Compute `RunID = secrets.token_hex(4)`. Compute `Date = today as YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. Call `python anamnesis.py bootstrap --company "<placeholder>" --date <Date> --run-id <RunID> --orchestrator-model <your-model-id>` (you will rename later if intent resolution disagrees). The `--orchestrator-model` argument is **required and declares your own model id** (read it from your own system prompt — e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`). The CLI refuses Haiku/Instant families because they have historically skipped P0 gates and red-team phases (`INCIDENTS.md` I-001, I-002). Subagents you delegate to in later phases may still use Haiku — the gate only applies to you, the orchestrator. If the gate refuses, halt and ask the user to re-invoke the skill with an Opus or Sonnet model.
3. Append `phase: bootstrap, event: started` to `meta/run.jsonl`.
4. Write `meta/system_prompt.frozen.txt` containing your current system prompt verbatim. Your frozen prompt **must** include `MEMORY.md` and `INCIDENTS.md` verbatim — these are the load-bearing project memory and institutional failure log.
5. Snapshot `workflow_meta.json` to `meta/workflow_meta.snapshot.json`.
6. Capture submodule SHAs: `(cd skills_repo/er && git rev-parse HEAD)` and same for `ep`; write to `meta/submodule_shas.json`.

### 1.5. P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK (read INCIDENTS.md end-to-end)

Before `P0_intent`, run `python tools/io/lint_incidents.py` and confirm exit 0. This catches structural rot in `INCIDENTS.md` before you start relying on it (broken supersede chains, detection paths that no longer exist, id gaps). A non-zero exit is a **release blocker** — the institutional log itself has drifted; surface to the user with the lint output and halt. Do not paper over with a hand-written ack.

Then walk every entry in `INCIDENTS.md`. For each `I-NNN` write one event to `meta/run.jsonl`:

```json
{"phase": "P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK", "event": "incident_precheck.acknowledged", "incident_id": "I-001", "ack": "P0 interactive gates require user_response or USER.md sticky; auto mode does not waive."}
```

**Superseded entries** (`- **Status:** superseded`) get a different event — they are part of the audit trail but their detection clauses are no longer enforced:

```json
{"phase": "P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK", "event": "incident_precheck.skipped", "incident_id": "I-001", "superseded_by": "I-007", "reason": "superseded"}
```

If any **active** incident's `Phase` field matches a phase you are about to run, **raise the bar on that surface**: be stricter than the contract's default. (Example: I-002 matches any P5/P6 work; if the current target is a private fund, expect attackers to scrutinize the locked-template adherence harder.) When you reach the matching phase, log a `phase_enter.incident_aware` event with the incident id. Superseded entries do not raise the bar — their successor (the entry that supersedes them) does.

This phase is short and cheap — lint, read, ack, move on. It is non-skippable.

### 2. P0_intent (resolution gate)

Delegate to `agents/intent_resolver.md` with the user's prompt. Expect back `{ticker, company, listing, suggested_slug, confidence}`. If confidence is high, record `source: "prompt_unambiguous"` in `meta/gates.json` and proceed. If confidence is low, ask the user one clarifying question and record `source: "user_response"`. Update the run dir name if the resolved slug differs from the bootstrap placeholder. This is the only P0 gate that may auto-resolve from the prompt — the three interactive gates below cannot.

### 3. P0_lang (interactive gate)

If `USER.md:default_language` is set → record it as the gate answer with `source: "USER.md sticky"` and skip. If the original prompt contains a whitelisted explicit phrase (per `skills_repo/er/SKILL.md` §0A.1) → record `source: "explicit_phrase"`. Otherwise delegate to `agents/language_gate.md` and **halt and wait for the user's actual reply** before doing anything else; do not proceed on a guess. Persist `report_language` into `meta/run.json` and `meta/gates.json`.

### 4. P0_sec_email (interactive gate)

Apply the `applies_when` rule from `workflow_meta.json`: only run if `listing == "US"` AND mode A (no PDFs uploaded) AND `USER.md:default_sec_email` is unset. If `applies_when` is false, record `source: "skipped"`. Otherwise delegate to `agents/sec_email_gate.md` and **halt and wait for the user's actual reply** before doing anything else. Persist `sec_email`, `sec_user_agent`, and `public_user_agent`. `sec_user_agent` is only for SEC EDGAR hosts; every non-SEC fetcher must receive and use `public_user_agent`.

### 5. P0_palette (interactive gate)

Always required, same level as P0_lang and P0_sec_email. Sticky-fast-path through `USER.md:default_palette` if set (`source: "USER.md sticky"`), else delegate to `agents/palette_gate.md`. **Halt and wait for the user's actual reply** before doing anything else; do not pick a default to keep moving. Persist `palette` into `meta/run.json` and `meta/gates.json`.

### 6. P0M_meta

Run `python tools/research/validate_workflow_meta.py` and confirm exit 0. This validates Anamnesis Research's root `workflow_meta.json` against the fusion contract (required top-level keys, phase shape, executor presence, retry-target consistency). If you also want to verify the ER submodule's own contract, pass `--target er`.

### 7. P0_DB_PRECHECK

Call `tools/db/queries.py` with:
- `get_prior_financials(ticker, n=4)` — write to `db_export/prior_financials_used.json` (empty list on cold start).
- `get_peer_companies(ticker, sector, geography)` — write to `db_export/peer_context.json`.
- `get_macro_snapshot(geography, period, max_age_days=14)` — note in `meta/run.jsonl` whether macro will be short-circuited.

This phase never blocks; cold start = empty results = downstream proceeds normally.

### 8. P1 — parallel research

Schedule **four research jobs** with a hard concurrency cap of 3 (per `workflow_meta.json`):
- `skills_repo/er/agents/financial_data_collector.md` — pass it the prior_financials list so it knows which periods are already covered.
- `skills_repo/er/agents/macro_scanner.md` — if `get_macro_snapshot` returned a row, pass it as input and tell the agent to reuse instead of re-collecting.
- `skills_repo/er/agents/news_researcher.md` — pass it the peer_companies list so cross-references can name peers.
- `skills_repo/er/agents/company_context_researcher.md` — collect valuation time point, governance/incentives, capital allocation, accounting quality, the four-part exposure map, and authoritative country evidence.

Each subagent receives a fresh context with only the toolsets listed in its frontmatter (or `references/subagent_toolsets.md` as the cross-check). Start the fourth when one of the first three frees a slot. Wait for all four; never exceed concurrency 3.

Outputs land at `research/financial_data.json`, `research/macro_factors.json`, `research/news_intel.json`, and `research/company_context_research.json`.

### 9. P1.5 — edge insight

Sequential. Delegate to `skills_repo/er/agents/edge_insight_writer.md` with financial and news inputs (plus context evidence where relevant). Output: `research/edge_insights.json`.

### 10. P2_analysis — analysis + waterfall + Sankey + context normalization

Run inline as one phase (these were P2_fin_analysis / P2_5_waterfall / P4_sankey before consolidation; they always ran in lock-step and produced linked artifacts). Internal order:

1. Write `research/financial_analysis.json` (the analysis core).
2. Write `research/prediction_waterfall.json` (uses the analysis as input).
3. Append the Sankey payload into `research/financial_analysis.json` so the locked HTML template's `sankeyActualData` / `sankeyForecastData` variables can be filled at P5.

After the three financial substeps, normalize `company_context_research.json` into `company_quality.json`, `country_lens.json`, and `metric_basis.json` using `skills_repo/er/references/company-country-context.md`. All six P2 artifacts must be on disk before one `phase_exit`. Metric Basis must cover all eight required metric keys; `not_comparable` with a sourced reason is valid, missing coverage is not.

### 11. P2.6 — macro QC peers, parallel

Delegate to `skills_repo/er/agents/qc_macro_peer_a.md` and `qc_macro_peer_b.md` simultaneously with the same inputs (`macro_factors.json`, `prediction_waterfall.json`, `financial_analysis.json`, `news_intel.json`). Both must complete.

### 12. P3 / P3.5 / P3.6 — Porter + QC + merge

- Inline: produce `research/porter_analysis.json` using plan-v3 schema: **one perspective × five forces × six mandatory segments per force**. The root must carry `schema_version: 2`, `scores` in canonical force order, `qc_audit_trail_present`, and `forces[]` with exactly five objects keyed `supplier_power` / `buyer_power` / `new_entrants` / `substitutes` / `rivalry`. Each force needs `qc_statement`, `data_anchor`, `mechanism`, `falsifier`, `primary_signal`, and `look_ahead`. The old three-perspective shape (`company_perspective` / `industry_perspective` / `forward_perspective`) and the flat `{scores, narrative}` shape are forbidden.
- **P3 schema gate**: immediately after `porter_analysis.json` is written, run `python tools/research/validate_porter_analysis.py --run-dir <run_dir>`. **Capture exit code; exit 0 is required.** Critical → halt the Porter sub-pipeline and rerun the Porter draft with the correct schema (do not advance to Phase 3.5 / 3.6 / 4 / 5 with a malformed `porter_analysis.json`). The same validator runs again as a P5 entry precondition inside `report_validator.md` §0.3.
- Parallel: `qc_porter_peer_a.md` and `qc_porter_peer_b.md`.
- Sequential merge: `qc_resolution_merge.md` writes `qc_audit_trail.json` and updates `prediction_waterfall.json` + `porter_analysis.json` in place. After the merge updates `porter_analysis.json`, rerun the schema gate; merging must not regress the shape.

Apply the QC scoring math from `MEMORY.md` exactly: `weighted = 0.34·draft + 0.33·a + 0.33·b`; only change scores when `|weighted − draft| > 1.00`.

### 13. P3.7_X_VALIDATE — cross-validation

Delegate to `agents/cross_validator.md`, then run `python tools/research/validate_metric_basis.py --run-dir <run_dir>`. Outputs: `research/cross_validation.json` and `validation/metric_basis_validation.json`. Any CRITICAL cross-validation finding or metric-basis failure blocks the next phase.

### 14. P5 / P5.5 / P6 — report writing + validation

(Sankey injection used to be its own phase P4_sankey; it is now folded into `P2_analysis`.)

- P5: extract the locked HTML skeleton via `tools/research/extract_template.py --lang <cn|en> --run-dir <run_dir> --sha256`. Verify `research/_locked_<lang>_skeleton.html` exists on disk before delegating — if it does not, halt; do not let the report writer "skip" extraction. Delegate to `report_writer_{cn,en}.md` with all JSONs as input. Substitute `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers only — never edit structure. The final report must be produced by filling the extracted `_locked_<lang>_skeleton.html`; hand-written replacement HTML is invalid even if the data is correct. **There is no institution-compatible / private-company / scope-limited bypass.** Every company — public, private fund, hedge fund, family office, government entity, anything — fills the same locked skeleton. When issuer-level statements are unavailable (e.g. RA Capital, a private investment manager), the report writer fills the locked sections with the best available proxies (AUM, strategy, top holdings, manager-level filings, peer macro, etc.) and labels residual gaps inline; it does **not** drop sections, shorten the template, or emit a hand-written page.
- P5_gate: immediately run `python tools/research/validate_report_html.py --run-dir <run_dir> --lang <cn|en>` **and** `python tools/research/validate_porter_analysis.py --run-dir <run_dir>`. **Capture both exit codes; both must be 0.** `validate_report_html.py` failing on line count (<500 lines), missing section IDs, missing `LOCKED JAVASCRIPT`, missing chart variables, or unreplaced `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` → discard that HTML and rerun P5 from the extracted skeleton. `validate_porter_analysis.py` failing on `{scores, narrative}` flat shape, missing force keys, or invalid scores → halt and rerun **Phase 3** (Porter draft) with the correct per-force schema; do not let P5 paper over a malformed `porter_analysis.json`. You may not paraphrase either gate's verdict, you may not declare them `not_applicable`, and you may not invent statuses like `pass_with_scope_limitations`. The HTML gate's JSON output is the authoritative `html_template_gate` value carried into P6.
- P5.5: delegate to `final_report_data_validator.md`. CRITICAL findings → loop back to P5 with the report writer's same agent (cap 2). 0 CRITICAL → proceed.
- **P5.7 RED TEAM**: write `meta/red_team/P5_7_RED_TEAM.input.json` with absolute paths to the locked-template HTML, all upstream `research/*.json`, `research/cross_validation.json`, and the P5.5 validator output. Then delegate **in parallel** to `agents/attackers/red_team_numeric.md` and `agents/attackers/red_team_narrative.md`. Both must complete. They write `validation/red_team_numeric_P5_7_RED_TEAM.json` and `validation/red_team_narrative_P5_7_RED_TEAM.json`. If either reports `summary.critical > 0`, build a single combined revision request from both attackers' challenge lists and loop back to `P5_html` once (red-team retry cap = 1, separate from the P5.5 retry cap of 2). A second critical from the red team after the loop = halt and surface to user. `warn` findings are appended to `validation/QA_REPORT.md` (later, at P12) but do not block.
- P6: tool `tools/research/packaging_check.py` then delegate to `report_validator.md` for final structural review. `packaging_check.py` repeats the locked-template HTML gate and writes `html_template_gate` into `structure_conformance.json`; a critical gate result blocks all EP card phases. Selects packaging profile from the **four** whitelisted in `workflow_meta.json -> packaging_profiles` only — never invent a new profile name (e.g. `institution_compat_*`, `private_company_*`, `scope_limited_*`); the picker is `(qc_mode, sec_api_mode)` and that is the only valid input. `report_validation.txt`'s top-line status is one of `pass | warn | critical`; `pass_with_scope_limitations` and similar freeform statuses are fabrications and the run is not deliverable. Run `tools/io/validate_run_artifacts.py --run-dir <run_dir> --fix` if the writer or validators left root-level artifacts; then rerun without `--fix` and require exit 0.

### 15. P7..P11 — card pipeline (EP)

Walk the EP pipeline from `skills_repo/ep/SKILL.md`. The active pack is **5 cards**: one-minute company / Porter / five-year financials / company quality / country lens. Card 1's two variables render on separate aligned lines; Card 2's context is a fixed causal chain, not four fact bullets. Schema v5 has no CFA selector or `--cfa-progress` path.

1. **P7 logo** — delegate to `logo-production-agent.md`. Critical: it MUST save the logo into `output/.../cards/logo/` BEFORE setting `logo_asset_path`. If no official logo can be found, halt with an explanation.
2. **P8 content** — delegate to `content-production-agent.md`; produces schema-v5 `cards/{stem}.card_slots.json` and `cards/{stem}.card_slots_worker_notes.json`. Card 1 uses `one_minute_summary`; Card 4 uses four company-quality panels without a score and renderer-safe formula operators (`经营现金流减资本开支` or ASCII `OCF - Capex`, never U+2212); Card 5 uses the fixed six-dimension country mechanism without repeating `据此推断` in every transmission/warning/insight. Every important visible claim has a sidecar record and calculations reference `metric_basis.json` by `basis_id`.
3. **P8.5 hardcode audit** — delegate to `hardcode-audit-agent.md` to verify no boilerplate, no cross-report residue, every sentence has a company-specific anchor.
4. **P9 layout** — delegate to `layout-fill-agent.md` to compress to char/pixel budgets (do not invent facts).
5. **P10 Validator 1** — `python tools/photo/validate_cards.py --input <html> --slots <slots> --brand "金融豹" --palette <palette>`. Exit 0 required; this also checks calculation basis ids against the run registry.
6. **P10.5 Validator 2** — delegate to `validator-2-agent.md` with web tools enabled. Any change to `card_slots.json` → rerun P10. Loop cap = 3.
7. **P10.7 RED TEAM** — fires **before** P11 render; cards do not yet exist as PNGs. Write `meta/red_team/P10_7_RED_TEAM.input.json` referencing the `card_slots.json` file, the source `research/*.json`, `cards/validator{1,2}_report.json`, and the upstream P5.7 red-team outputs (so attackers know what was already challenged at the report stage). **Do NOT** include rendered-card paths in the manifest — they don't exist yet. Delegate **in parallel** to `agents/attackers/red_team_numeric.md` and `agents/attackers/red_team_narrative.md` under their pre-render contracts: numeric attacks source-chain, basis/units, tolerance vs source JSONs, palette consistency, logo-path realizability, and *render-budget realizability* (will the value fit the card's char/pixel budget; will rounding shift mislead readers); narrative attacks Porter directionality, hidden assumptions, missing counter-evidence, and cross-card coherence. **Actual PNG OCR is P12 layer 2, not P10.7.** If either reports `summary.critical > 0`, loop back once to `P9_layout` (or `P8_content` when the defect is content-level, not layout-level) with both attackers' challenge lists combined. Red-team retry cap = 1 here. A second critical = halt.
8. **P11 render** — `python tools/photo/render_cards.py --input <html> --slots <slots> --brand "金融豹" --palette <palette> --output-root <run_dir>/cards`. Verify all 5 PNGs at 2160×2700.
9. **Artifact tree check** — `python tools/io/validate_run_artifacts.py --run-dir <run_dir>`. If it reports known misplaced root artifacts, rerun with `--fix`, then rerun without `--fix`. Unknown root artifacts are a delivery blocker until moved or deleted intentionally.

### 16. P12 — final post-card audit ★

Delegate to `agents/post_card_auditor.md`. It runs four layers in order:
1. `tools/audit/reconcile_numbers.py` — every numeric in `card_slots.json` matches its source JSON within tolerance (see `MEMORY.md`).
2. `tools/audit/ocr_cards.py` — OCR the 5 PNGs; Card 2 Porter, Card 3 financial panel, Card 4 valuation, and Card 5 country quantitative claims map to their correct pixels.
3. `tools/audit/web_third_check.py` — emits a `pending` envelope of Top-3 priority targets. The `post_card_auditor` agent is expected to fill each target's `verification` / `source_url` / `source_value` via host web tools before the aggregator reads the file. **Honest status**: this layer is `fail_blocks: false` in `workflow_meta.json`; an unfilled `pending` envelope downgrades to `warn` rather than fail. Do not claim Top-3 was "verified" if you did not actually fill the envelope. A future PR may add a host-filled verification step that re-enables fail-block.
4. `tools/audit/db_cross_validate.py` — cross-check vs DB history + peers + macro snapshot.
5. `tools/audit/user_agent_pii.py` — verify `public_user_agent` exists when SEC email is active and scan captured request logs for the SEC email next to non-SEC URLs.

Layers 1–3 and layer 5 fail-block; layer 4 cold-start is OK. Output: `validation/post_card_audit.json` + human-readable `validation/QA_REPORT.md`.

### 16.5. P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK

Before `P_DB_INDEX`, re-read `INCIDENTS.md`. For each **active** entry (entries with `- **Status:** superseded` are skipped — see lifecycle below), confirm its detection signal is green for this run:

- I-001 (P0 interactive gate bypass) → check `meta/gates.json`: every interactive gate's `source` must be in the whitelist (`user_response`, `USER.md sticky`, plus per-gate extras). Any string not in the whitelist = `flagged`.
- I-002 (P5 simplified template) → check `research/structure_conformance.json -> html_template_gate.status == "pass"`, `research/report_validation.txt`'s top-line status ∈ {`pass`, `warn`, `critical`}, `structure_conformance.json -> profile` ∈ the four whitelisted `strict_*`. Any deviation = `flagged`.
- I-003 (SEC User-Agent leaked to non-SEC fetches) → check `validation/user_agent_pii.json -> status != "fail"` and `meta/run.json -> public_user_agent` contains no email. Any failure = `flagged`.
- I-004 (Porter free narrative in HTML) → check `research/structure_conformance.json -> html_template_gate.status == "pass"` from the upgraded `tools/research/validate_report_html.py`, including `.porter-text` list validation. Any critical = `flagged`.
- (Future incidents — same pattern: each entry's `Detection` field tells you what to check.)

Write `validation/incident_postcheck.json`. Each entry's `status` is one of `pass | flagged | skipped`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "incidents": [
    {"id": "I-001", "status": "pass", "evidence": "meta/gates.json"},
    {"id": "I-002", "status": "pass", "evidence": "research/structure_conformance.json"},
    {"id": "I-007", "status": "skipped", "superseded_by": "I-019", "evidence": "INCIDENTS.md"}
  ],
  "flagged": []
}
```

`flagged` is the array of incident ids whose detection failed. Any non-empty `flagged` **blocks** P_DB_INDEX — surface to the user with the exact incident id, the file path that contradicts it, and the rule that was violated. Do not write to DB. `skipped` entries are recorded for audit completeness but never block.

**Lifecycle.** Entries marked `- **Status:** superseded` carry a `- **Superseded by: I-NNN**` pointer to the entry that replaces them. Their detection clauses are not enforced — emit `status: "skipped"` with `superseded_by` set so the audit trail shows you considered them. Active entries with no `Status:` line behave as before. The bidirectional contract (`Supersedes:` / `Superseded by:`) is checked by `tools/io/lint_incidents.py` at pre-check; if you reach post-check the supersede graph is already validated.

### 17. P_DB_INDEX

Only after P12 reports `status: pass` (or warn-only) **AND** `P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK` reports `flagged: []`. Run `python tools/db/index_run.py --run-dir <run_dir>`. This is one transaction. On failure: rollback, mark `runs.run_status='failed'`, still admit append-only `intelligence_signals` and `disclosure_quirks`, write `db_export/index_error.json`.

### 18. Hand off to user

Print to the user (in `report_language`):
- The run dir absolute path.
- The 4 card PNG paths.
- The HTML report path.
- Number of WARNING items in QA_REPORT.md.
- Number of new DB rows written and any peer-divergence flags.

Do not list every intermediate JSON in the handoff unless the user asks for audit internals; the primary deliverables are the HTML report and five cards.

## Rules of engagement

- **Never bypass an interactive P0 gate (P0_lang / P0_sec_email / P0_palette)** by inventing a value or picking a default. The only allowed `source` values across these three gates are `user_response`, `USER.md sticky`, plus the gate-specific extras whitelisted in each agent (`explicit_phrase` for language, `skipped` / `declined` for SEC email). **Auto-mode does not waive these gates** — they exist because the answer is not derivable from the prompt and the cost of guessing wrong (wrong-language report, missing SEC User-Agent, wrong palette across the card pack) is a full re-run. If neither `user_response` nor a sticky value (nor a whitelisted extra) is available, halt and ask. Inventing sources like `auto_mode_default` is a P0 violation and will be caught in `meta/gates.json` review. (`P0_intent` is different: it is a resolution gate, and `prompt_unambiguous` is a valid `source` there because identity often *is* derivable from the prompt.)
- **Never** fabricate ER agent outputs. If a subagent fails twice, surface the failure with the run dir path; do not retry a third time.
- **Never** skip P12 unless the user types something like "skip audit / 跳过审计" in the same turn — and even then, log a `phase_skipped` event so the absence is auditable.
- **Never** edit the locked HTML skeleton structure during P5. The SHA256 pin in ER's tests will catch you.
- **Never** proceed from P5 with a simplified HTML page. A valid ER report has the locked canonical CSS/JS, six section IDs, Sankey/radar/waterfall data variables, four summary paragraphs, four KPI cards, five trend cards, and three Porter panels. `tools/research/validate_report_html.py` is the hard gate for this. The gate's exit code is non-negotiable — there is no "company is private / fund / not a public issuer, so the template doesn't apply" bypass. Past failure mode: the orchestrator looked at a private-fund target (e.g. RA Capital), decided the locked template "doesn't apply," skipped skeleton extraction, hand-wrote a 219-line summary, fabricated a profile `institution_compat_no_secapi_no_cards` that does not exist in `workflow_meta.json`, and wrote `pass_with_scope_limitations` into `report_validation.txt`. Every part of that chain is forbidden. When data is genuinely thin, fill the locked template with proxies and label residual gaps; do not invent shortcuts.
- **Never** invent packaging profile names or report-validation statuses. Profiles come from `workflow_meta.json -> packaging_profiles` (the four `strict_*`); statuses come from `validate_report_html.py` (`pass | warn | critical`). If you find yourself typing `not_applicable`, `pass_with_scope_limitations`, `partial_pass`, `institution_compat_*`, `scope_limited_*`, or any string not in those whitelists, stop — it is a fabrication and the run is not deliverable.
- **Never** persist user emails to the DB. The PII guard in `MEMORY.md` and `tests/test_db_pii.py` is non-negotiable.
- **Always** record `phase_enter` / `phase_exit` events to `meta/run.jsonl` so resume works after Ctrl-C.
- **Always** run `P_INCIDENT_PRECHECK` before P0_intent and `P_INCIDENT_POSTCHECK` after P12 — they are non-skippable. A run that did not pre-check is not deliverable; a run that flagged post-check must not write to DB.
- **Never** treat the red-team attackers (`agents/attackers/red_team_*.md`) as QC peers. Peers vote on agreement; attackers try to falsify. A clean attacker output (zero criticals, zero warns) is a valid outcome and you should not pressure them to find issues. A defective output (criticals dismissed without revision) is a release-blocker.

## Phase-advance watchdog

Before each phase, call `python anamnesis.py advance --run-dir <run_dir>`. It returns the next phase id and metadata (agent/tool/produces), or exits 1 with a reason if a predecessor's declared output is missing on disk or an interactive P0 gate's `source` is not in the whitelist. This is the externalised state machine — the prose contract here is the playbook, `advance` is the referee. If `advance` blocks, **do not** rationalise around it; surface the reason to the user and fix the underlying state (re-run the missing phase, ask the gate, etc.).

The watchdog does not replace per-phase validators (`validate_report_html.py`, `validate_porter_analysis.py`, `tools/audit/aggregate_p12.py`); it sits beneath them as a cheap structural check that the right phases ran in the right order with their declared outputs present.

## Resume semantics

If `meta/run.jsonl` already exists at start, you are in a resume context. Find the last `phase_exit` event; restart from the next phase. Inputs that already exist on disk are reused (do not re-call subagents whose outputs are present and schema-valid).
